# Mathematical models of Regression and classification from scratch
## The mathematics behind the Machine Learning
 Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning various domains, from finance and healthcare to marketing and autonomous systems.
 Two fundamental tasks in ML are regression and classification, both of which involve predicting outcomes based on input data. 
 This repository delves into the mathematical foundations that underpin regression and classification models, exploring key concepts and algorithms.

 ## Introduction:
Machine Learning models are designed to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 
Regression and classification are two essential branches of supervised learning where the mathematical foundations play a crucial role.

 ## Regression Models:
Regression aims to predict a continuous target variable based on input features. The foundational equation for linear regression is:

ε is the error term. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method minimizes the sum of squared errors to find optimal coefficients.



## Classification Models:
In contrast, classification involves predicting the class labels of instances. Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification. The logistic function transforms the linear combination of inputs into probabilities:

The decision boundary is determined by a threshold, and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation is often used to find optimal coefficients.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM):
SVM is a powerful algorithm for both regression and classification. In classification, SVM aims to find a hyperplane that maximally separates data points of different classes. 
The margin, the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points, is maximized. For regression, 
SVM minimizes deviations from the regression line within a specified margin.

## Decision Trees:
Decision trees recursively split data based on feature values to create a tree-like structure. 
In regression, the average target value of leaf nodes is used for prediction, while in classification, the majority class determines the output. 
The mathematics involve entropy and information gain for optimal feature selection.

## Neural Networks:
Deep Learning models, particularly Neural Networks, have gained prominence. 
The mathematics behind neural networks involve forward and backward propagation using techniques like gradient descent to optimize weights. 
Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn complex relationships.

## Evaluation Metrics:
Common metrics for assessing regression models include Mean Squared Error (MSE), while classification models are often evaluated using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics quantify the performance of models and guide their refinement.

## Conclusion:
Understanding the mathematical foundations of regression and classification models is essential for practitioners in the field of Machine Learning.
From linear equations to complex neural networks, the mathematics behind these models form the basis for their development, training, and evaluation. 
As ML continues to advance, a solid grasp of these mathematical concepts is crucial for researchers and practitioners alike.
